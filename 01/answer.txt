In a sentence, this code prints out the factors of 12. The first 2 lines assign variables that essentially determine the start and end points of the following while loop block. the while loop begins with i as 2 and number as 12, then loops through all the numbers leading up to 12 because the last line in the while loop is incrementation, where variable i is increased. However, when i becomes 12, the loop ends because the condition for the loop is no longer met (12 < 12 isnâ€™t true). In the while loop, there is an if statement that includes modular arithmetic. The if statement checks whether 12 is divisible by the value stored in i (if the remainder is 0 when the numbers are divided). If so, the number stored in i is printed. Otherwise nothing happens and i is just incremented again. What will happen when this code runs is that 2,3,4, and 6 will be printed.
